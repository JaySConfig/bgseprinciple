  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">The BGSE Principle: A Complete Guide</h1>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Is The BGSE Principle?</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">The BGSE Principle is a simple four-question test that instantly reveals when someone is trying to manipulate or control you. It cuts through emotional manipulation with pure logic, helping you distinguish between reasonable requests and inappropriate demands.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Four Questions:</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Before feeling guilty about someone's demands on you, ask these questions:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>B</strong> - Can they <strong>Buy</strong> it?</li>
    <li><strong>G</strong> - Can they <strong>Give</strong> it away to someone else?</li>
    <li><strong>S</strong> - Can they <strong>Sell</strong> it?</li>
    <li><strong>E</strong> - Can they <strong>Euthanise</strong> it?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>The Rule:</strong> If the answer to ALL of these questions is NO, then they have zero ownership over it — which means they have zero right to demand it from you.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How It Works: Real Examples</h2>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Your Time:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Can they buy your Saturday? No.</li>
    <li>Can they give your evening to someone else? No.</li>
    <li>Can they sell your weekend? No.</li>
    <li>Can they euthanise your time? No.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>Result:</strong> They cannot demand your time. They can ask, but not demand.</p>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Your Attention:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Can they buy your focus? No.</li>
    <li>Can they give your attention away? No.</li>
    <li>Can they sell your interest? No.</li>
    <li>Can they euthanise your attention? No.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>Result:</strong> They cannot demand your attention.</p>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Your Life Choices:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Can they buy your career decisions? No.</li>
    <li>Can they give your choices to someone else? No.</li>
    <li>Can they sell your life path? No.</li>
    <li>Can they euthanise your decisions? No.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>Result:</strong> They cannot demand you change your choices.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Understanding Ownership vs. Relationships</h2>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">A Dog (Owned):</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>You bought it</li>
    <li>You can give it away</li>
    <li>You can sell it</li>
    <li>You can euthanise it</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-4"><strong>Therefore:</strong> You own it and can control its life.</p>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">A Person (Relationship):</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>You cannot buy them</li>
    <li>You cannot give them away</li>
    <li>You cannot sell them</li>
    <li>You cannot euthanise them</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>Therefore:</strong> You don't own them and cannot control their life.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Key Distinction: Ask vs. Demand</h2>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Appropriate (Asking):</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>"Would you like to spend Sunday together?"</li>
    <li>"Could we have dinner this week?"</li>
    <li>"I'd love to see you more often"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Inappropriate (Demanding):</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>"You HAVE to visit because family comes first"</li>
    <li>"You're being selfish by not spending time with me"</li>
    <li>"Good children always put their parents first"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Principle Works</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>It's Logical:</strong> Based on basic ownership rules</li>
    <li><strong>It's Universal:</strong> Applies to all relationships</li>
    <li><strong>It's Immediate:</strong> Works in real-time when you're pressured</li>
    <li><strong>It's Unassailable:</strong> Hard to argue with</li>
    <li><strong>It's Memorable:</strong> BGSE is easy to recall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Common Applications</h2>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2 mb-1">Family:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Excessive demands from parents or siblings</li>
    <li>Guilt about life choices</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Romantic:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Controlling where you go, who you see</li>
    <li>Pressure to change who you are</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Friendships:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-2">
    <li>Expecting constant access</li>
    <li>Pressure to drop everything for them</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Work:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Pressure to sacrifice personal time</li>
    <li>Unreasonable expectations around availability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Origin Story</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">The BGSE Principle was developed from a real-world need to explain boundaries to someone who couldn't understand why they couldn’t control their adult daughter. The insight came from recognising that people sometimes treat loved ones like possessions — expecting the same control they have over things they actually own.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">What This Principle Teaches You</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>Your autonomy is not negotiable</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Guilt is often manipulation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Relationships require consent</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You're not responsible for others' emotions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ownership equals control</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Final Thought</h2>
  <p class="mb-10">The most powerful aspect of the BGSE Principle is that it transforms guilt-inducing demands into clear boundary violations. When someone fails the ownership test, you can confidently say no without feeling guilty about protecting your autonomy.</p>
