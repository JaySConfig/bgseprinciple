  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">The BGSE Principle: You Are Not Owned By Anyone</h1>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What Is The BGSE Principle?</h2>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>You are not owned by anyone.</strong> The BGSE Principle is a simple test that instantly reveals when someone is trying to manipulate or control you. It cuts through emotional manipulation with pure logic, helping you recognise that you have the right to say no without guilt.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Four Questions</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">When someone makes demands on you, ask yourself:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li><strong>B</strong> - Can they <strong>Buy</strong> you?</li>
    <li><strong>G</strong> - Can they <strong>Give</strong> you away to someone else?</li>
    <li><strong>S</strong> - Can they <strong>Sell</strong> you?</li>
    <li><strong>E</strong> - Can they <strong>Euthanise</strong> you?</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6"><strong>The answer is NO.</strong> They don’t own you — so they have no right to demand anything from you.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Nobody owns you. Nobody owns your love, your life, your time, or your affection. You can give those things to whoever you choose. It’s your decision alone — not theirs, no matter what they’ve done for you or how long you’ve known them. <strong>You don’t owe anyone anything.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Ownership: The Dog Analogy</h2>
  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
    <div>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">A Dog (You Own It)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>You bought it</li>
        <li>You can give it away</li>
        <li>You can sell it</li>
        <li>You can euthanise it</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2"><strong>Therefore:</strong> You own it and can control its life.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">A Person (You Don’t Own Them)</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>You cannot buy them</li>
        <li>You cannot give them away</li>
        <li>You cannot sell them</li>
        <li>You cannot euthanise them</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2"><strong>Therefore:</strong> You don’t own them and cannot control their life.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How To Use The Principle</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">The four questions establish the fundamental truth: <strong>nobody owns you</strong>. Once you know this, you can apply it to whatever demand someone is making on you.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">When someone tries to manipulate you, remind yourself: they don't own you — so they can’t control your choices, your time, your body, your emotions, or your life decisions.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Recognising Common Family Manipulations</h2>

  <div class="mb-6 space-y-4">
    <div>
      <p><strong>"You can’t go travelling, we need you here."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">They don’t own you — they can’t control where you go or when.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>"You’re being selfish by not visiting more."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">They don’t own your time — you decide how often to visit based on your life.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>"After all we’ve done, you owe us grandchildren."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">They don’t own your body — reproductive choices are yours alone.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>"You’re wasting your education — think of the money we spent."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">They don’t own your future — past investment doesn’t entitle them to control.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p><strong>"If you really loved us, you’d break up with them."</strong></p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">They don’t own your heart — your relationship is your choice, not theirs.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="mb-6 italic text-gray-700">You are not a repayment plan. Love is not a debt.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Key Distinction: Ask vs. Demand</h2>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
    <div>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Appropriate (Asking):</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>"Would you like to spend Sunday together?"</li>
        <li>"Could we have dinner this week?"</li>
        <li>"I’d love to see you more often."</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Inappropriate (Demanding):</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>"You HAVE to visit because family comes first."</li>
        <li>"You’re being selfish by not spending time with me."</li>
        <li>"Good children always put their parents first."</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why This Principle Works</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>It’s Logical:</strong> Based on fundamental ownership concepts everyone understands</li>
    <li><strong>It’s Universal:</strong> Applies across all relationships and cultures</li>
    <li><strong>It’s Immediate:</strong> Cuts through guilt in real-time</li>
    <li><strong>It’s Unassailable:</strong> Even manipulators can’t argue with it</li>
    <li><strong>It’s Liberating:</strong> Gives you permission to stop feeling guilty for having boundaries</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Origin Story</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">The BGSE Principle came from trying to explain to someone why they couldn’t control their adult daughter like they controlled their dog. The breakthrough was recognising that people often treat family like possessions — expecting the same control they have over things they actually own.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What This Principle Teaches You</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li><strong>Your autonomy is non-negotiable</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Guilt is often a manipulation tool</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Relationships require ongoing consent</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You’re not responsible for others’ emotions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Nobody owns you</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Applications Beyond Family</h2>

  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Romantic Relationships:</h3>
    <p>They don’t own you — so they can’t control your friendships, career, or goals.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Friendships:</h3>
    <p>They don’t own you — so they can’t demand constant availability or override your needs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Workplace:</h3>
    <p>They don’t own you — so they can’t demand you sacrifice your personal life beyond reason.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Remember</h2>
  <p class="mb-10">You are not responsible for managing other people’s emotions about your autonomous choices. The BGSE Principle helps you maintain this crucial boundary by providing logical clarity when emotions run high.</p>

  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-10">
    The four questions prove nobody owns you. Once you know this truth, you can confidently protect your autonomy without guilt — because you are not owned by anyone.
