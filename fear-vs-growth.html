  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Fear-Based vs. Growth-Based Living</h1>
  <p class="italic text-gray-700 mb-8">The path of least resistance often leads to the garden of least fulfilment.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Two Ways to Live Your Life</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Every decision you make comes from one of two places: <strong>fear</strong> or <strong>growth</strong>. Understanding which one drives you can completely change your life trajectory.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fear-Based Living</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">When you live from fear, you make decisions to avoid potential problems rather than pursue potential joy.</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Staying in situations that make you unhappy because change feels risky</li>
    <li>Choosing what’s familiar over what’s fulfilling</li>
    <li>Making decisions based on "what could go wrong" instead of "what could go right"</li>
    <li>Prioritising safety over meaning</li>
    <li>Avoiding challenges to prevent potential failure</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">The result: You end up in what I call <strong>"the garden of least fulfilment"</strong> — a life that feels safe but empty.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Growth-Based Living</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">When you live from growth, you accept uncertainty and challenge in pursuit of meaning and expansion.</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Choosing opportunities that scare you but align with your values</li>
    <li>Accepting temporary discomfort for long-term fulfilment</li>
    <li>Making decisions based on potential rather than just security</li>
    <li>Viewing challenges as opportunities to develop, not threats to avoid</li>
    <li>Taking calculated risks for meaningful rewards</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">The result: A life that feels <strong>alive</strong>, even when it’s difficult.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Key Difference</h2>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
    Fear-based thinking: "What if this goes wrong?"<br>
    Growth-based thinking: "What if this goes right?"
  </blockquote>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Which Mode Are You In?</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Ask yourself:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Are most of your major life decisions driven by avoiding something bad or pursuing something good?</li>
    <li>Do you feel more alive when taking on challenges or when everything is predictable?</li>
    <li>When you imagine your future, do you think about security or possibility?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Choice</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">You don’t have to live your entire life from one mode. But recognising which one currently drives your decisions is the first step to choosing consciously.</p>
  <p class="mb-10">Remember: <strong>The path of least resistance often leads to the garden of least fulfilment.</strong></p>
