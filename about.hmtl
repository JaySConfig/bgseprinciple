  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About</h1>

  <p class="mb-6">I’m someone who spent years dealing with manipulative family dynamics and boundary violations. Through that experience, I developed frameworks that helped me think clearly and protect my wellbeing.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">These aren’t academic theories — they’re practical tools that worked for me in real situations. I’m sharing them because I wish someone had given me this clarity years ago.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">I’m not a therapist or psychologist. I’m just someone who learned to recognise manipulation, set boundaries, and choose growth over comfort. If these frameworks help even one person avoid the stress and confusion I went through, then sharing them is worth it.</p>

  <p class="mb-10 italic text-gray-700">Sometimes the most valuable insights come from people who’ve been in the trenches, not from textbooks.</p>
