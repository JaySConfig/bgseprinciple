  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">The Manipulation Detection Framework</h1>
  <p class="italic text-gray-700 mb-8">Spotting when someone is trying to control you.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #1: Your Emotions Become Their Responsibility</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>"You’re making me feel unloved"</li>
    <li>"Your choices are hurting me"</li>
    <li>"I can’t be happy when you’re doing this"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: Adults are responsible for managing their own emotions. When someone makes you responsible for how they feel, they’re trying to control your choices through guilt.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #2: Extreme Reactions to Normal Boundaries</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Crying, yelling, or shutting down when you say no</li>
    <li>Treating reasonable requests as personal attacks</li>
    <li>Escalating dramatically when you set limits</li>
    <li>Acting like your independence is abandonment</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: Healthy people can handle disappointment without emotional warfare. Extreme reactions are designed to make you afraid to set boundaries.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #3: Making Themselves the Victim of Your Choices</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>"After everything I’ve done for you…"</li>
    <li>"You’re being <a href="selfishness-myth.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">selfish</a> by living your own life"</li>
    <li>"You’re abandoning the family"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: They’re reframing your healthy choices as attacks on them, making you the villain for living authentically.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #4: Using Others to Pressure You</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>"Everyone thinks you’re being unreasonable"</li>
    <li>Getting family members to call and guilt you</li>
    <li>Public complaints about your behaviour</li>
    <li>Creating a campaign against your choices</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: If their case was reasonable, they wouldn’t need reinforcements. This is about overwhelming you with pressure, not legitimate concern.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #5: Conditional Love and Attention</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Withdrawing affection when you don’t comply</li>
    <li>Giving you the silent treatment for <a href="dont-give-reasons.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">setting boundaries</a></li>
    <li>Only being warm when you’re doing what they want</li>
    <li>Making their love contingent on your obedience</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: Real love doesn’t require compliance. This is training you to associate their approval with your submission.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Red Flag #6: Crisis Creation</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Creating emergencies when you’re pulling away</li>
    <li>Sudden health scares during important events in your life</li>
    <li>Dramatic threats when they’re not getting their way</li>
    <li>Perfect timing of "crises" to derail your plans</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">Why it’s manipulation: The timing reveals the agenda. Real crises don’t consistently happen when it’s most convenient for controlling you.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Pattern</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>They make your choices about them</li>
    <li>They escalate when boundaries appear</li>
    <li>They use emotion as a weapon</li>
    <li>They treat your autonomy as a threat</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What to Do</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Name it internally: "This is manipulation, not legitimate concern"</li>
    <li>Don’t defend or explain: <a href="guilt-conditioning-recovery.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Manipulation invites more manipulation</a></li>
    <li>Hold your boundaries: Giving in rewards the behaviour</li>
    <li>Document patterns: Trust your observations over their explanations</li>
    <li>Seek support: Talk to people outside their influence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Remember</h2>
  <p class="mb-10">Manipulation works by making you doubt yourself. Trust your instincts — if someone’s reaction to your healthy choices feels wrong, it probably is.<br><br>You’re not responsible for managing other people’s emotions about your decisions.</p>
