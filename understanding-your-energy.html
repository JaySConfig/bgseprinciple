  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Understanding Your Energy System</h1>
  <p class="mb-8 italic text-gray-700">Not everyone is wired the same way. Understanding your energy system — and others' — can prevent conflict and help you make better life choices.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">High-Energy Systems</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Some people are naturally wired for high output and stimulation. High-energy people typically:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Need <a href="fear-vs-growth.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">novelty, challenge, and growth</a> to feel fulfilled
    </li>
    <li>Get restless and depressed when understimulated</li>
    <li>Find routine and predictability draining</li>
    <li>Require mental and physical engagement to feel balanced</li>
    <li>See change as exciting</li>
    <li>Feel energised by taking on new challenges</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">When understimulated, they experience:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Physical restlessness and tension</li>
    <li>Mental fog and depression</li>
    <li>Feeling like they’re <a href="garden-of-least-fulfilment.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">"wasting away"</a></li>
    <li>A desperate need to escape familiar environments</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Low-Energy Systems</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Other people are naturally wired for stability and conservation. Low-energy people typically:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Find comfort in routine and predictability</li>
    <li>Feel overwhelmed by too much novelty or change</li>
    <li>Prefer familiar environments and known quantities</li>
    <li>See change as potentially threatening</li>
    <li>Need stability to function well</li>
    <li>Feel energised by maintaining rather than pursuing</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">When overstimulated, they experience:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Anxiety and overwhelm</li>
    <li>Desire to retreat to familiar comfort zones</li>
    <li>Feeling like change is too much</li>
    <li>Need for stability and routine to rebalance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Mismatch Problem</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Conflicts arise when people with different energy systems try to impose their needs on each other:</p>
  <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
    High-energy person to low-energy: "You’re too comfortable — you need to grow and take risks!"<br>
    Low-energy person to high-energy: "You’re too restless — you need to settle down and be content!"
  </blockquote>
  <p class="mb-6">Neither is wrong — they just have different operating systems.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Know Your System</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">Understanding your natural energy system helps you:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
    <li>Make life choices that work with your nature, not against it</li>
    <li>Stop judging yourself by others’ standards</li>
    <li>Choose environments and relationships that support rather than drain you</li>
    <li>Recognise when conflicts are about different wiring, not character flaws</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Key Insight</h2>
  <p class="mb-10">Your energy system isn’t a choice — it’s how you’re built. The choice is whether you honour it or fight against it. <strong>Work with your wiring, not against it.</strong></p>
